# FFXIV-Alert

#### Description:
FFXIV Alert is a website that connects to a custom REST api and displays data about current character creation restrictions for all servers in Final Fantasy XIV. This data is automatically updated every 15 seconds. A user of this website can select certain servers to be notified on when character creation opens back up. When a selected server's character creation opens up, the user is informed via a sound notification and a desktop notification (if allowed by the user and supported by the browser).

A link to the website can be found <a href="https://www.ffxivalert.com">here</a>.
